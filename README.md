## Name
SIMple PLot for Everyone (SIMPLE)

## Description
Tool to compare the products from sets of published stellar models, including (but not limited to) core-collapse supernovae. 

## Installation
TBD

## Usage
Notice that depending on the machine where this is done, some changed are needed in cell 1. For instance, there are the changes required in Victoria astrohub to work:

%matplotlib nbagg
-->
%pylab ipympl

and comment the following line (in another machine, just update with the correct path):

"sys.path.append('/home/marco/work/NuGridPy')"


## Support
If you have specific questions about the models, the detailed references and relative email contact points are provided below. 

## Roadmap
This is preliminarty version still under development, requiring more testing etc. Please keep this in mind.
